# TowerDefenseGame
# this is a tower defense game with themes from star wars, halo, and my computer science department.
# the songs from the starwars level are not my own, the sound effects are from short clips from the films
# the halo sounds are freely available online but are not my own either.
# the songs from the halo level and the C.S. level are my own creation and available on youtube at "Lord Job Jeffrey Elliott"
# the teacher sound effects were taken from their lectures and converted to the .wav format here
#
# This game was made in IntelliJ, and that is what is recommended for running this program, though I've had success running it with VS Code with the right plugins, and Eclipse should work as well or any other IDE for Java.
